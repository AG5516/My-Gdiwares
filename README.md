# My-Gdiwares

A collection of GDI programs I made back then, some were leaked, some were published myself.
The reason why I decided to publish the ones that weren't leaked, like Sindonium and Xerastium is because I they weren't good, and they're not special to me.

### I honestly wished I never made stuff like this back then.
